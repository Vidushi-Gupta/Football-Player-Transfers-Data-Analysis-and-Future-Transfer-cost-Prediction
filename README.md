# Football Player Transfers Data Analysis and Future Transfer cost Prediction

## Abstract

The purpose of this project was to analyze expensive football player transfers and create a machine learning-based model which could predict the transfer fee of football players based on some range of data. Nowadays, concepts of Data Science and AI are widely used in almost every sphere. Many football clubs use such techniques to maximize their profit.
The project demonstrates one way to develop such a technique. The first phase of the project included data collection, analysis, visualization, and interpretation. Largely the concept of Linear regression was applied for the project. After model evaluations, respective conclusions, visualizations, and interpretations were made.

## Problem definition

Football players transfer from time to time from one club to another, it might be a profitable practice to analyze previous trends and make predictions based on that.
To objective is to predict the transfer fee of football players based on some range of data by analyzing, interpreting, extrapolating and predicting results.
